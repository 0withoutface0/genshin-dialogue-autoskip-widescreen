# genshin-dialogue-autoskip

This script automatically speeds up dialogue in Genshin Impact, always choosing the bottom dialogue option. 

This is for educational purposes only, and I advice against relying on the script in daily gameplay, as it will ruin your story experience.

Usage:
- after running the script, press F8 to start skipping dialogue and F9 to pause.
- press F12 to quit

The script requires the following:
- The game running on Main Display 1
- Run in Admin mode to allow key and mouse emulation
