# genshin-dialogue-autoskip

This script automatically skips dialogue in Genshin Impact, always choosing the bottom dialogue option. 

This is for educational purposes only. I advice against relying on the script in daily gameplay, as it will ruin your story experience.

The script requires the following:
- The game running on Main Display 1 in 1920x1080.
- Run in Admin mode to allow key and mouse emulation.

Usage:
- After running the script, press F8 to start and F9 to pause.
- Press F12 to quit.
