# genshin-dialogue-autoskip

This script automatically skips dialogue in Genshin Impact.

Chooses the bottom dialogue option with keyboard + mouse.
Chooses any available dialogue option with DS4 gamepad.

This is for educational purposes only. I advice against relying on the script in daily gameplay, as it will ruin your story experience.

The script requires the following:
- The game running on Main Display 1 in 1920x1080.
- Run in Admin mode to allow key and mouse emulation.

Usage:
- After running the script, press F8 to start and F9 to pause.
- Press F12 to quit.

NB!
Program automatically defines the UI version, currently autodetects ENG/RUS keyboard+mouse UI and RUS DualShock4 UI.
To use with DS4 gamepad, the autoplay button must be activated using square button.
